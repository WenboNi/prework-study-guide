        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page as it merely adds a buffer</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you're actually make the entire element bigger</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Must link externall CSS file to the HTML file. Just because our files are in the same project repository does mean they know about each other. To do this, we use the HTML link element</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page, use a special wild car symbol, asetericks. This way, we will have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have they style properties in the element set to a cetain way.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>It is also important to remember that since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
          <li>Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
          <li>Math Floor and Math Random are both properties of JavaScript's built-in math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
